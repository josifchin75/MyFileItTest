        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            MyFile-It is a company that has been formed to market its mobile phone app to the youth sports and education industry for use of scanning important documents like medical releases, physical forms, parent or guardian permission forms and player medical history information and other important information. These forms are required by an organization before any athletes can try out or play. At this point, there is no software program to organize and make this procedure more efficient for the organization. Normally, the organization sends out the form requirements to the athlete’s parents. The athlete brings the documents to the first try-out. Some staff person needs to verify the documents and then collect and copy them so they can give a copy to the coach or staff in case of an emergency. As you can see, there are many steps through this process in which things can go wrong. In addition, there’s no guarantee that coach or staff members have brought the copies to the event. This opens the door to possibilities of a large liability suit. In addition managing and verify permissions slips has always been a mess and most organization would a easy ways to collect and verify them which MyFile-It offers
